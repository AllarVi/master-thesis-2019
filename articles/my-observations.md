# My observations

There is definitely potential for improving **non-invasive field-based methods** to quantify and monitor technical biomechanical movements for specific sports. Human cognitive skills give coaches with long history in specific sports the ability to recognize mistakes in technical movements. We believe that a coach with 20 years of experience in coaching can easily recognize when a player's two-handed backhand stroke has something lacking, for example the player's shoulders are not properly aligned for maximum stroke efficiency.

I believe recognizing these mistakes in athlete's techniques can be categorized under pattern detection problems and decoupled from humans to computers. Computers could potentially accumulate far more experience than any human ever.
