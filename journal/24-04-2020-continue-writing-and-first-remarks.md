- [x] check out "Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network for Skeleton Based Action Recognition" sent by Sven. In conclusion, the paper proposes a very interesting approach, but it is rather complicated to implement. It would be easier to first implement the simplest form of RNN human action recognition and later try to implement something more sophisticated and compare the results.
