Today I'm constructing the final dataset for the neural network.

I'm doing this by filtering out instances where either multiple persons were in the video and it caused body parts to be messed up. 

Deleted instances:

* backflip-11-hendrik
* backflip-12-hendrik
* backflip-13-hendrik
* backflip-14-gert
* backflip-15-gert
*
